`ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

**All PRs must include a commit message with the description of the changes made!**

1. `git pull`, before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your main needs to be up to date.

```

```

2. Create a new branch from `main` like: `548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`.<br/>

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat (make sure you're on the correct branch!)

## Dependencies

Please avoid introducing new dependencies to House Arena without consulting the maintainer. New dependencies can be very helpful, but they also introduce new security and privacy risks, add complexity, and impact the total project size.

Adding a new dependency should have vital value for the product with minimum possible risk.

## Introducing New Features

We would 💖 you to contribute to House Arena

For us to find the right balance, please open an issue explaining your ideas before introducing a new pull request.

This will allow the us to sufficiently discuss the new feature value and how it fits within the product roadmap and vision.
